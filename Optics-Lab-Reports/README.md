## 🚀 Future Research Directions
While these reports reflect my initial experimental findings, I aim to enhance precision through computational and digital methods:
* **Numerical Simulation:** To model optical phenomena, allowing a more rigorous comparison between theoretical ideals and laboratory reality.
* **Scientific Programming (Python):** To automate data processing and error analysis, reducing manual calculation uncertainties.
* **Digital Calibration:** To minimize human-reading errors and improve the overall reliability of measurements in future setups.

## 🛠 Technical Overview
* **LaTeX:** Used for typesetting reports to ensure a clear and structured presentation of mathematical equations.
* **TikZ:** Used for illustrating fundamental optical paths and experimental setups.
* **PGFPlots:** Used for generating experimental data plots and linear fits to maintain technical accuracy.
* **Images:** Included as supporting visual documentation alongside the **.tex** source and **PDF** reports.
